# GORA-pedestrian-tracker

GORA Lane Pedestrian Tracker attempts to count the number of pedestrian passing through a specific sidewalk at a given time. This is done by applying a computer vision model, specifically YOLOv3, applied to a CCTV camera in order to automatically track pedestrian traffic and create analytics based from this.
